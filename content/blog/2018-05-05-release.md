It's been a year since I started working on an Xcode project parser with the goal of implementing a tool that would help large teams scale their Xcode projects. At that time I was doing a lot of research on how modularizing Xcode projects _(you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/pepibumur/microfeatures-guidelines))_ helped overcoming common issues such as compilation times, which **had a very negative impact on developers productivity and motivation.**

Modularization turned out to be a good first step, but not enough. Modularizing a codebase results in a lot of workspaces, projects, schemes and targets that we need to maintain, and that has an associated cost. Although Xcode facilitates it a bit by providing things like configuration files to reuse build settings, most of the settings are codified into Xcode projects, that we can **only modify using the API that Apple provides, Xcode.**

With the help of a lot of contributors we built a Swift open source project, xcproj _(which has been recently renamed to [xcodeproj](https://github.com/xcbuddy/xcodeproj))_ to provide a new API that I could leverage
