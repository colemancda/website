section: basics
description: Once the project is defined in a Project.swift file, we can generate an Xcode project to work with. In this page you'll learn how to do it.

I've been wondering how many things that I do, I do them because everyone does them. With everyone sharing how they do things, and pitching us their library, their work-style, or even their tools I think software engineers are strongly biased by external opinions, including me. Are you using VIPER because it's a good fit for your project's needs or because you saw a few companies using it? Are you using that library because it's saving you time, or because you saw an example of how to use it and you thought you could go with replicating the example?

```swift
let test = "Hello World"
```
