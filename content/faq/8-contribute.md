question: "How can I contribute?"
---

You can contribute in many different ways. Here are some ideas:

* **Ideas:** We have a [Spectrum Community](https://spectrum.chat/xcbuddy) where you can get to know other people using the project and start discussions around ideas you have for the tool. If there's something that you think could be improved from xcbuddy, or even something that could be added because Xcode doesn't handle it very well don't hesitate to open a discussion.
* **Reporting issues:** Did you find a bug in the tool and you'd like to report it? We have a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/xcbuddy/xcbuddy/issues) where you can create issues with the bugs that you found. When you create an issue, it'll be pre-filled with a template that you should stick to provide us as much information as possible.
* **Coding:** If you'd like to get your hands dirty you can open a PR on any of the organization of the repositories. xcbuddy is entirely written in Swift so if you are familiar with the language and the _Foundation_ SDK you'll feel comfortable working with the codebase. Drop me a line at [pepibumur@gmail.com](mailto://pepibumur@gmail.com) if you'd like to get onboarded on any of the projects. I'll be happy to give you introduction.
