question: "What if we want to stop using it in the future for whatever reason?"

One of the xcbuddy's core values is to be as aligned as possible to what developers are used to with Xcode. That's why xcbuddy doesn't replace the build system or doesn't make decisions about your workspace/projects/targets structure. The tool just leverages the dynamism of project generation to offer you nice productivity-focus features. In case you'd like to stop using xcbuddy, you could generate the Xcode projects, include them in your repository, and use your own automation scripts or tools like Fastlane.
