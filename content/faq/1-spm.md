question: "How does it differ from the Swift Package Manager?"
---

Although xcbuddy has many things in common with SPM, like the command line interface, the manifest definition in Swift, or the project generation, xcbuddy **focuses on scaling Xcode projects**, rather than doing dependency resolution and helping developers implement tools in Swift. SPM's responsibility might overlap more with xcbuddy's in the future since there seems to be plans to give support to other platforms such as iOS.
