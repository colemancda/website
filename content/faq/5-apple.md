question: "Might Apple provide something like xcbuddy from Xcode?"

Definitively. They are taking good steps, but optimizing for large scale issues has never been a priority when it comes to deciding what to introduce in the tools they release,primarily Xcode and its build system. Certificates and provisioning profiles management is a good example. Although they've introduced improvements in the past years, the solutions they came up with are not suitable for large teams. Tools like Fastlane Match were designed with that in mind instead.
